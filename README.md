OpenFold
========

A PyTorch reproduction of DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 and code to train the model.

https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold

Uni-Fold
========

Modified the open-source code of DeepMind AlphaFold v2.0 and code to train the model from scratch

alphafold-multistate
====================

Multi-state modeling of protein structures using AlphaFold based on custom template databases

https://github.com/huhlim/alphafold-multistate

AlphaFold-analysis
==================

Collection of scripts to survey a directory of alphafold multimer runs. It will go in each directory and make pLDDT and PAE plots delimited by sequence, provided the results directory contains a .fasta of the sequence. Will make all summary files and plot all PAE, pLDDT etc.

Kosinski AlphaFold 2.0 fork
============================

The old fork that includes command line version of the old ColabFold notebook.
To be deprecated but still useful until ColabFold brings back the "old" sokrypton_alphafold2_advanced mode to batch.
